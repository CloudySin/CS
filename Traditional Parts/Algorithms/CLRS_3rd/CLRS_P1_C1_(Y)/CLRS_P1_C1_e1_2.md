#1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithm content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.
- Example: Excel.
- Function: It need sorting algorithms to sort of course...

#1.2-2 Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n^(2) steps, while merge sort runs in 64nlg(n) steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?
-
	so ( n < 8lgn ) 
	so { 2<=n<=44 }

#1.2-3 What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^(2) runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^(n) on the same machine?
- 
	so { n >= 15 }
