##4.2-1	Use Strassen’s algorithm to compute the matrix product􏰑
## [1 3􏰖􏰑]   [7 5]
## [6 8]􏰖 * [4 2]
##	Show your work.
> Done on my notebook.

##4.2-2	Write pseudocode for Strassen’s algorithm.
> Strassen’s algorithm.cpp

##4.2-6	How quickly can you multiply a kn􏰇n matrix by an n􏰇kn matrix, using Strassen’s algorithm as a subroutine? Answer the same question with the order of the input matrices reversed.
- Not willing to do.

##4.2-7	Show how to multiply the complex numbers a + bi and c + di using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take a, b, c, and d as input and produce the real component ac 􏰃 bd and the imaginary component ad C bc separately.
