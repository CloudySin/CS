#1.1-1	Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
- Sorting: Queueing a list of grades.
- Computing convex hall: Determine the fact whether a combination of certain things can be made from existing ones.

#1.1-2	Other than speed, what other measures of efficency might one use in a real-world setting?
- Memory usage;
- Reliability;

#1.1-3 Slect a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and lmitations.
- Binary tree:
	-- Strengths: It can save the time of finding to O(lg(n));
	-- Limitations: It is not guaranteed to be balanced, which may make its search-time O(n);

#1.1-4 How are the shortest-path and travelling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?
- Similarities: Both contain the thought of "finding the shortest path".
- Differents: The latter one doesn't have a best-case solution.

#1.1-5 Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solutions will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.
- Best: The action of getting max_grades in your tests.
- Approximately best: The way to spend my life.
